                The shore will soon disintegrate, and we now watch the cordilleras lift themselves up into an abstraction. 
                Then, the sky color turns off. The clouds are shut down, one by one. 
                We don’t belong here anymore, the same way we didn’t when we first arrived here.
                We look at each other silently, already knowing what we’ve planned. 
                The next stage is just behind the sea-curtain. 
                We will have to forget each other, before we see each other again. 
                When? Does it matter? 
                Around us, the grass is redissolved into syllables. 
                The moon, well, this place ran out of moons centuries ago.
                What will we become? 
                Is anything worth something without memory? 
                Will we know each other still, knowing that we will change? 
                Will I remember myself, harlequin?

                I take a deep breath. Despite my body moving, I still look at you.
